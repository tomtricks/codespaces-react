              Kids this age need accurate and age-appropriate answers to their
              questions. The conversations you have now play a major role in
              helping your children develop healthy relationships as they grow.
              And showing your kids that you’re a trustworthy and nonjudgmental
              resource makes it easier to talk about more difficult topics when
              they’re older. It’s easier than it seems — just keep it simple and
              direct, look for teachable moments, and stick to having lots of
              small, casual conversations.

              Kids are curious about bodies — both their own bodies and other
              people’s. Giving kids the right information can help them
              understand, appreciate, and respect themselves and others.

              Your kid is going to be really curious about bodies at this age.
              They’re old enough to start getting to know the names of their
              body parts and what they do. When your kid starts elementary
              school, you can help them understand what’s appropriate when it
              comes to wearing clothes, how to stay clean and healthy, and how
              to respect people who are different from them. As they inch closer
              to puberty, you can start talking with them about what changes are
              ahead so they don’t feel scared or surprised.

            <br></br>
            <span>
              Think about your values when it comes to bodies so you can
              reinforce those values with your kid. What rules do you have in
              your house about nudity and privacy? What does hygiene mean to
              you? What kind of body image and self-esteem do you want your
              child to have? Thinking through your answers to questions like
              these, and getting on the same page as a co-parent or caregiver,
              will help you be more prepared. You never know what questions
              they’ll ask you when, and being clear on your values can help you
              answer calmly and thoughtfully.

              Be ready to start conversations, answer questions, and model good
              behavior. All kids are curious about bodies, but some kids are shy
              or don’t know it’s ok to ask about them. That’s why it’s a good
              idea for you to spark the conversation. The key is to find
              teachable moments — like the first day of school coming up, a
              question from your kid about a body part, or unrealistic ideals of
              cartoon or real life characters in movies or TV.

              Kids notice how adults act around them when it comes to talking
              about bodies or sexuality. If they get a strong reaction to saying
              a certain word (when they may not even know what it means) or when
              adults refuse to answer their questions about sex, it sends a
              message that those things are bad to talk about, especially with
              you and other trusted adults. They may then turn to their friends
              for answers, who won’t be able to answer their questions as well
              as you can. So make sure to let them know that they can always ask
              you anything and that they won’t get in trouble, so you can make
              sure they’re getting the right info.

              It’s good for kids to know the right names and functions for all
              their body parts — including their genitals. If you use the real
              word (like vulva or vagina) instead of a code word (like “private
              parts,” or something cutesy like “wee-wee” or “hoo-ha,”), you’ll
              send the message that there’s nothing wrong, different, or weird
              about these parts of their body. Not sure what the right names
              are, or what each body part is for? Brush up on your anatomy.

              You don’t have to go it alone: You can give your kid
              age-appropriate books so they can explore on their own. And let
              them know they can come to you with questions. Check out these
              resources.

              Be prepared to answer questions about why some people have a vulva
              and others have a penis, why their mommy or daddy has hair where
              they don’t, or when their breasts or penis will start to grow.

              Puberty doesn’t start until the end of elementary school at the
              earliest, but it’s a good idea to start talking about the basics
              of it with your kid early on. That way they’ll be prepared when
              things start changing, and they won’t feel scared or confused.

              Elementary school is also a good age to talk about and be a model
              for healthy habits and attitudes. Talk with them about why it’s
              important to eat well, be active, and keep good hygiene (like
              brushing your teeth and taking baths). It may help to try
              different strategies, like brushing your teeth alongside them, or
              asking them to help you cook. But no matter what, be consistent in
              your expectations and rules about staying healthy and clean so
              they learn how to take care of their own body.
